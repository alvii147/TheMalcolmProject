## Inspiration
Protesting against malicious policies or unethical treatment is human nature and will always be a key tool of civilization. With hundreds of thousands of people taking part in various movements or boycotting events, it is crucial to organize these events in a peaceful, civil way. This is where The Malcolm Project comes in.

## What it does
Named in honour of Malcolm X for his contribution in the civil rights and the Black Power movements, The Malcolm Project is a platform that allows users to create, join and organize protesting events at a specific place and time. Users have the ability to explore protests according to their locations and filter events by time, place or cause.

## How I built it
This project is entirely built using Python library Flask, along with HTML, CSS, and SQLAlchemy.

## Challenges I ran into and what I learned
The most difficult part of this project was organizing every page and database in a tidy manner. I found that HTML template inheritance is key to having a neat website layout.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is the first time I've developed a fully-functioning web app! Most of my focus has always been embedded/hardware related, so I'm very happy and excited to have found another passion in web development.

## What's next for TheMalcolmProject
Expanding for sure! I'm still not done with this website, I was to improve its features and hopefully program more user interactivity into it!
